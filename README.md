* Cloning components within the app
* Support for apps' local development, enabling:
  * [cloning Make apps to the local workspace and a repository, for example, git](make-apps-editor/apps-sdk/local-development-for-apps/clone-make-app-to-local-workspace.md)
  * [development of multiple app versions, e.g. deploying one code to testing and production app](make-apps-editor/apps-sdk/manage-testing-and-production-app-versions.md)
  * pulling updates or new app components to the local workspace and a repository
  * [versioning of the app](make-apps-editor/apps-sdk/local-development-for-apps/compare-changes-between-local-and-make-app.md)
  * collaborative development
  * control over code contributions
  * [local development and deploying local app code back to Make](make-apps-editor/apps-sdk/local-development-for-apps/develop-app-in-a-local-workspace-offline.md)
