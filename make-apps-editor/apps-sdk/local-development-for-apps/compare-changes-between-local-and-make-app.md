One feature available to developers is the "Compare with Make" functionality. This tool allows developers to compare the code in their local app with the code in their Make app.&#x20;

By leveraging this feature, developers can easily identify differences, track changes, and ensure consistency between their local and Make apps.

To compare the code of a local component with a remote component, right-click the local component block and select **Compare with Make (beta)**.
