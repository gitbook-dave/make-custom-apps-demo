# Commit the changes in Git repository

Whenever you create a new package of changes, you can commit them to create a new version in the Git repository.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The manual describes the development in the Git repository using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app. Yet it's not obligatory, any preferred [GUI tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) can be used.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to the GitHub Desktop app and open the repository with the latest version of your app. You should see a list of new changes.
2. Enter the Summary, optionally the Description of the commit, and click **Commit to main**.
