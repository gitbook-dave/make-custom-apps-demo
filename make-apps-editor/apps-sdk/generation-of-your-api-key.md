Add more API scopes to your API key if you want to use them. The description of the API scopes is documented in the [Make API documentation](https://www.make.com/en/api-documentation/authentication).
{% endhint %}

5\. Click the **Save** button to confirm selected permissions.

6\. Copy your new API key to your clipboard and store it in a safe place. **This is the only time when you can see the whole API key.** The API key is required to set up the VS code extension.
